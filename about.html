  <h2>about</h2>
  Welcome to my <i>RPG Stuff</i> website. Here you can find a small number of 
  tools that can be used with tabletop roleplaying/storytelling games. 
  Currently, there are only a couple of items on this site, but I plan to make 
  more as I have the time to do so. All of these projects have been hand-coded 
  by me. If you like these resources and want to show your appreciation, click
  the donate link at the top of the screen and buy me a beer! Enjoy!
